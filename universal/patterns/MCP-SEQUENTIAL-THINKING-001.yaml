    title: "Sequential Thinking MCP Server - Advanced Reasoning"
    severity: "medium"
    scope: "universal"

    problem: |
      Complex problems require structured reasoning:
      - Breaking down complex tasks
      - Multi-step planning
      - Consideration of alternatives
      - Avoiding logical fallacies
      - Structured decision-making

    solution: |
      Sequential Thinking MCP server enables advanced reasoning:
      - Problem decomposition
      - Multi-step planning
      - Structured analysis
      - Decision support
      - Chain-of-thought reasoning

    features:
      - Break problems into steps
      - Explore alternatives systematically
      - Identify dependencies
      - Validate reasoning chains
      - Provide explanations

    installation:
      global: "claude mcp add sequential-thinking -s user -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      local: "claude mcp add sequential-thinking -s local -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"

    requirements:
      - Node.js and npx for execution
      - Claude Code CLI for installation

    usage_examples:
      - "Plan the architecture for a microservices system"
      - "Break down the implementation of a feature"
      - "Analyze the pros and cons of different approaches"
      - "Debug complex issues systematically"

    benefits:
      - Structured problem-solving
      - Better planning and estimation
      - Reduced oversight
      - Clearer communication
      - Improved decision-making
