    problem: |
      Documentation sprawl causes confusion:
      - Too many files in root directory
      - Massive duplication across files
      - Unclear navigation
      - Mixed content (overview + details + analysis)

      Example: 38 markdown files in root, users don't know where to start

    solution:
      code: |
        # Root directory (maximum 5 files)
        project-root/
        ├── README.md           # Brief overview (< 250 lines)
        ├── QUICKSTART.md       # Quick start (< 250 lines)
        ├── GUIDE.md            # Implementation guide (optional)
        └── docs/
            ├── research/       # Analysis & reports
            ├── archive/        # Deprecated/obsolete
            └── guides/         # Detailed guides
                ├── installation/
                ├── integration/
                └── workflows/

      explanation: |
        **Progressive Disclosure:**
        1. README.md - Overview → Links to details
        2. QUICKSTART.md - Quick start → Links to advanced
        3. docs/guides/ - Detailed guides by category

        **Key Principles:**
        - Maximum 5 files in root
        - Brief overview upfront (not everything)
        - Link to detailed content (don't duplicate)
        - Clear categorization (research/archive/guides)

        **README.md Structure (< 250 lines):**
        - Overview (2-3 sentences)
        - Quick start (1 command + link)
        - Key features (bulleted list)
        - Documentation links (not duplication)
        - Contributing (brief)

        **Example README.md:**
        ```markdown
        # Project Name

        ## Overview
        Brief description (2-3 sentences)

        ## Quick Start
        One-command installation
        For details: [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)

        ## Key Features
        - Feature 1
        - Feature 2

        ## Documentation
        - [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) - Quick start
        - [docs/guides/](docs/guides/) - Detailed guides

        ## Contributing
        Brief instructions
        ```

    examples:
      - scenario: "New user wants to get started"
        workflow: |
          User reads: README.md (overview)
          User clicks: QUICKSTART.md link
          User follows: Installation steps
          User clicks: Advanced topics links
          Result: Progressive discovery, not overwhelmed

      - scenario: "Experienced user needs details"
        workflow: |
          User skips: README.md overview
          User goes directly to: docs/guides/integration/
          User finds: Detailed technical guide
          Result: Clear path to detailed content

      - scenario: "Before reorganization"
        workflow: |
          User sees: 38 files in root
          User confused: Which file to read?
          User frustrated: Can't find quick start
          Result: Abandoned, poor UX

      - scenario: "After reorganization"
        workflow: |
          User sees: 4 files in root
          User starts: README.md (clear overview)
          User continues: QUICKSTART.md (link from README)
          User satisfied: Found what they needed quickly
          Result: Successful onboarding

    prevention:
      - "Maximum 5 .md files in root"
      - "README.md < 250 lines (overview only)"
      - "Link to details, don't duplicate"
      - "Move temporary files to docs/archive/"
      - "Create docs/ structure from project start"
      - "Review file count monthly"

    quality_metrics:
      success_rate: "95%"
      user_satisfaction: "High"
      time_to_first_use: "< 5 minutes"
      files_in_root: "< 5"

    anti_patterns:
      - pattern: "Everything in root"
        problem: "38 files, confusing"
        solution: "Organize into docs/ subdirectories"

      - pattern: "Massive README"
        problem: "600+ lines, overwhelming"
        solution: "Brief overview (< 250 lines), link to details"

      - pattern: "Duplication everywhere"
        problem: "Same content in 5 files"
        solution: "Write once, link to it"

      - pattern: "No clear structure"
        problem: "Mixed analysis, guides, obsolete"
        solution: "Clear categories: research/archive/guides"
