    problem: |
      Project root directories become cluttered with many files:
      - 20+ Markdown documentation files in root
      - Configuration files mixed with content
      - No clear separation between user docs, curator docs, and AI tool docs
      - Difficult to navigate for new contributors
      - Hard to maintain as project grows

      **Real example:** Shared Knowledge Base v3.0 had 21 .md files in root before cleanup.

    root_cause: |
      1. No documentation placement strategy
      2. All docs added to root for "convenience"
      3. No separation of concerns
      4. Not thinking about scalability

    solution:
      clean_directory_structure:
        description: "Maintain clean root with ≤7 essential files"

        root_max_files: 7

        essential_files_only:

          future:

          example: "vps/README.md, python/README.md"
          rule: "Keep category-specific docs with content"

        before_creating_doc:
          checklist:
            - "Who will read this? Users, curators, or AI tools?"
            - "Is it essential for all users? → Root"
            - "Is it for maintainers only? → curator/"
            - "Is it for AI tools only? → for-claude-code/"
            - "Is it project-specific? → <category>/README.md"

      migration_checklist:
        phase_1_assessment:
          - "Count .md files in root"
          - "If >7, need cleanup"

        phase_2_categorize:
          - "List all files in root"
          - Mark each: user, curator, AI, project-specific"

        phase_3_create_directories:
          - "mkdir -p curator/"
          - "mkdir -p curator/metadata/"
          - "mkdir -p for-claude-code/"

        phase_4_move_files:

        phase_5_verify:
          - "Count files in root (should be ≤7)"
          - "Test all documentation links"
          - "Update README.md references"

      real_world_example:
        project: "Shared Knowledge Base v3.0"

        before:
          root_files: 21
          structure: "All docs in root, no separation"
          problems:
            - "Hard to navigate"
            - "Unclear who should read what"
            - "Maintenance difficult"

        after:
          root_files: 5
          structure: |
            Root: README.md, GUIDE.md, QUICKSTART.md, SUBMODULE_VS_CLONE.md
            curator/: 13 files (organization, skills, workflows, etc.)
            curator/metadata/: 5 files (architecture, implementation, etc.)
            for-claude-code/: 2 files (Claude Code integration)

        improvements:
          - "76% reduction in root files"
          - "Clear separation of concerns"
          - "Easy navigation"
          - "Professional structure"

      best_practices:

          reason: "Prevent creep"

        - item: "Use descriptive directory names"
          examples: ["curator/", for-claude-code/", "NOT docs/"]

      anti_patterns:
        - ❌ "Add all docs to root for 'convenience'"
        - ❌ "Mix user and curator documentation"
        - ❌ "Create docs/ for everything"
        - ❌ "Put project-specific docs in root"
        - ❌ "Use generic names like documentation/"

      validation:
        root_directory_check:
          command: "ls -1 *.md | wc -l"
          max_files: 7
          action_if_exceeded: "Perform cleanup"

        structure_check:

            ls -1 for-claude-code/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l  # Should have files

          expected_results:
            - "curator/ exists and has INDEX.md"
            - "No user docs in curator/"
            - "No curator docs in root"

    problem: |
      When integrating shared knowledge base or reusable components into projects:
      - Unclear whether to use git submodule or direct clone
      - Team uses different approaches inconsistently
      - Wrong choice leads to maintenance problems
      - No clear decision criteria
