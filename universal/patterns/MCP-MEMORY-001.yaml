    title: "Memory MCP Server - Persistent Context"
    severity: "medium"
    scope: "universal"

    problem: |
      Claude Code loses context between sessions:
      - No memory of previous conversations
      - Forgetting project preferences
      - Repeating explanations
      - No historical context
      - Lost learning from past tasks

    solution: |
      Memory MCP server provides persistent context:
      - Cross-session memory
      - Project preferences storage
      - Historical context retention
      - Knowledge persistence
      - Learning from past tasks

    features:
      - Store and retrieve memories
      - Project-specific memory
      - User preferences
      - Contextual associations
      - Semantic search

    installation:
      global: "claude mcp add memory -s user -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      local: "claude mcp add memory -s local -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"

    requirements:
      - Node.js and npx for execution
      - Claude Code CLI for installation

    usage_examples:
      - "Remember my preference for TypeScript over JavaScript"
      - "Recall the decision we made about API design"
      - "What did we learn from the last bug fix?"
      - "Store this architectural decision for future reference"

    benefits:
      - Persistent context across sessions
      - Reduced repetition
      - Better continuity
      - Project knowledge retention
      - Improved personalization
