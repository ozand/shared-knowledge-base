    problem: |
      Projects need reusable knowledge units for common workflows.
      Without skills, teams face duplication, inconsistent approaches,
      and difficulty sharing knowledge across projects.

    impact: |
      - **Duplication:** Same solutions implemented multiple times
      - **Inconsistency:** Different approaches for same problems
      - **Discovery:** Hard to find existing solutions
      - **Maintenance:** Changes need to be applied in multiple places

    solution:
      code: |
        # .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

        ## What this Skill does
        Brief description of what the skill accomplishes

        ## Trigger
        - User mentions specific keywords
        - Context indicates need for this workflow
        - Related tools are used

        ## What Claude can do with this Skill

        ### 1. Task Description
        Step-by-step instructions...

        ### 2. Prerequisites
        - Required tools
        - Required context
        - Required permissions

        ### 3. Examples
        ```bash
        # Example usage
        command with options
        ```

        ## Resources
        ### Reference Material
        - Link to docs

        ### Code Examples

      explanation: |
        **Core Concepts:**

        1. **Skills vs Other Tools:**
           - **Skills:** Reusable procedures ("how to")
           - **Projects:** Context knowledge ("what to know")
           - **MCP:** External integrations ("where to find")
           - **Prompts:** One-time instructions ("do this now")

        2. **Auto-Activation:**
           - Skills load based on context relevance
           - No explicit invocation needed
           - Claude detects need automatically

        3. **Skill Structure:**
           ```
           .claude/skills/my-skill/
           ├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file
           ├── resources/            # Reference material
           │   ├── guide.md
           │   └── examples.md
           └── examples/             # Code examples
               └── basic-example.py
           ```

        4. **Best Practices:**
           - One skill = one clear purpose
           - Include concrete examples
           - Keep descriptions concise
           - Test skills thoroughly
           - Document triggers clearly

    anti_patterns:
      - pattern: "Overly broad skills"
        problem: "Activate too often, not specific enough"
        solution: "Split into focused, single-purpose skills"

      - pattern: "No examples"
        problem: "Hard to understand how to use"
        solution: "Always include concrete examples"

      - pattern: "Vague triggers"
        problem: "Activates in wrong contexts"
        solution: "Be specific about when to use"
