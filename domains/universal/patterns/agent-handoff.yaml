    problem: |
      **Context:** Shared Knowledge Base is used across multiple projects.

      **Scenario:**
      - Project Agent (in project-A) discovers reusable error pattern
      - Pattern should be in Shared KB for all projects to benefit
      - But Project Agent is NOT responsible for maintaining Shared KB
      - Shared KB Curator Agent (in shared-knowledge-base) is responsible

      **Challenge:**
      How do project agents contribute improvements to Shared KB without:
      - Direct write access to shared-knowledge-base repository?
      - Breaking existing validation rules?
      - Creating duplicate entries?
      - Waiting indefinitely for review?

      **Wrong Approach:**
      ❌ Project Agent directly commits to shared-knowledge-base
      ❌ Project Agent sends email/message to curator
      ❌ Pattern is documented only in project-A (not shared)
      ❌ Issue created without details, sits in backlog forever

    solution:
      workflow: "GitHub Issue-Based Handoff"

      phase_1_project_agent_discovers_pattern:
        role: "Project Agent (in any project using Shared KB)"
        trigger: "Encounters reusable error/solution"

        steps: |
          1. Working on project task
          2. Encounters error or discovers improvement
          3. Searches Shared KB: kb search "error keyword"
          4. Pattern NOT found in KB
          5. Solves the problem
          6. Considers: "Is this reusable for other projects?"

        decision_reusable:
          questions:
            - "Does this apply to multiple projects/environments?"
            - "Is this framework-agnostic or standard use case?"
            - "Would other developers benefit?"

          if_yes:
            action: "Contribute to Shared KB"
            goto: "phase_2"

          if_no:
            action: "Add to project-local KB"
            steps: |
              - Create entry: docs/knowledge-base/project/errors/*.yaml
              - Mark: local_only: true
              - Validate: kb validate
              - Commit to project repo (not shared KB)
              goto: "end"

      phase_2_create_yml_entry:
        role: "Project Agent"
        steps: |
          1. Create YAML file following KB template:
             ```yaml
             version: "1.0"
             category: "category-name"
             last_updated: "2026-01-06"

             errors:  # or patterns:
               - id: "CATEGORY-NNN"
                 title: "Descriptive Title"
                 severity: "high"
                 scope: "python"  # or universal, javascript, docker, postgresql

                 tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
             ```

          2. Validate locally:
             ```bash
             python tools/kb.py validate your-entry.yaml
             ```

          3. If validation fails:
             - Fix YAML syntax
             - Add missing required fields
             - Re-validate
             - Continue until ✓ passed

             # Validate
             python tools/kb.py validate temp.yaml
             ```

          5. Check for duplicates:
             ```bash
             kb search "title keywords"
             grep -r "ID" errors/ patterns/
             ```

          6. Assess quality:
             - Problem description clear?
             - Solution tested and working?
             - Code examples correct?
             - Appropriate scope?
             - No typos, correct YAML?

          7. Estimate effort:
             - Small (15min): Minor edits, ready to merge
             - Medium (1hr): Needs improvements, testing
             - Large (2-3hr): Major rework, more examples needed

        steps: |
          **Project Agent:**
          1. Encounters asyncio.TimeoutError in production
          2. Searches KB: kb search "asyncio timeout"
          3. Not found
          4. Implements solution with timeout handling
          5. Determines: "Reusable for any async Python code"
          6. Creates YAML: python/errors/async-timeout.yaml
          7. Validates: ✓ Passed

          **Project Agent:**
          1. Trying to initialize KB metadata
          2. Gets error: "Invalid YAML at line 410"
          3. Investigates: postgresql/errors.yaml:410
          4. Finds: mapping value with colon not quoted
          5. Fixes: Changes to single quotes
          6. Validates: ✓ Passed
          7. Creates GitHub issue #16 with label "yaml-error"

          **Curator Agent:**
          1. Reviews issue #16 (high priority label)
          2. Validates fix: ✓ Correct
