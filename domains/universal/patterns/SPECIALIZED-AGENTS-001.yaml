  title: Specialized Agents System for Development Workflows
  severity: critical
  scope: universal
  problem: 'Using a single general-purpose Claude agent for complex development tasks
    leads to:

    - Mixed context between different types of work

    - Generic feedback lacking domain expertise

    - Difficulty maintaining specialized knowledge

    - No clear separation of concerns

    - Agents trying to be "everything to everyone"


    Complex software development requires specialized expertise across multiple domains:

    - Business analysis and requirements

    - Project management and coordination

    - User experience design

    - Technical architecture

    - Database design

    - Backend development

    - Frontend development

    - Code quality and review

    - Security assessment

    '
  symptoms:
  - Claude provides generic feedback across all domains
  - Context gets mixed between different types of reviews
  - No focused expertise in specific areas
  - Difficulty tracking which agent handled what
  - Agents don't "remember" previous conversations in their domain
  - Inconsistent quality across different types of tasks
  root_cause: 'Single general-purpose agent attempts to handle all specialized tasks

    without domain-specific focus, expertise, or context isolation.

    explanation: 'The Specialized Agents System provides domain-specific AI agents

      for complex development workflows, ensuring focused expertise

      and clear separation of concerns.


      **Key Benefits:**


      1. **Focused Expertise** - Each agent specializes in one domain

      2. **Clear Boundaries** - Agents know what they do and don''t do

      3. **Sequential Handoffs** - Structured workflow between agents

      4. **Context Isolation** - Each agent maintains domain context

      5. **Quality Assurance** - Multiple perspectives on deliverables

      6. **Scalability** - Easy to add new specialized roles


      **Nine Specialized Roles:**


      1. **Business Analyst** - Requirements gathering, business analysis

      2. **Project Manager** - Planning, coordination, timeline management

      3. **UX Engineer** - User experience design, interface specifications

      4. **Tech Lead** - Technical architecture, system design

      5. **Database Engineer** - Database schema, data modeling

      6. **Backend Engineer** - Server-side implementation, API development

      7. **Frontend Engineer** - Client-side implementation, UI development

      8. **Code Reviewer** - Quality assurance, best practices validation

      9. **Security Reviewer** - Security assessment, vulnerability analysis


      **Handoff Pattern:**

      - Each agent receives input from predecessors

      - Each agent produces output for successors

      - Clear deliverables at each stage

      - Documented handoff criteria


      **Integration with Claude Code:**

      - Agent files in `.claude/agents/`

      - Each agent has description and instructions

      - Use `/agents` command to manage agents

      - Agents auto-invoke based on task type
