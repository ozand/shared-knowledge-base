  title: Curator Decision Framework for Project Agent Contributions
  severity: high
  scope: universal
  tags:
  - curator
  - decisions
  - agent-handoff
  - workflow
  - quality-gate
  problem: 'When Project Agents submit GitHub issues proposing universal patterns,

    Curator needs consistent decision framework for:

    - Accept (integrate into Shared KB)

    - Request changes (feedback to agent)

    - Reject (not universal, suggest project KB instead)


    **Challenge:** How to decide consistently and communicate clearly?

    '
  decision_framework:
    workflow: 3-Path Decision Tree
    step_1_triage:
      role: Curator
      action: Review GitHub issue from Project Agent
      checks:
      - check: Follows AGENT-HANDOFF-001 format?
        pass: Continue to step 2
        fail: Request format fix
      - check: Has GITHUB-ATTRIB-001 attribution?
        pass: Continue to step 2
        fail: Request attribution
      - check: YAML validation passed?
        pass: Continue to step 2
        fail: Request YAML fixes (see YAML-001)
    step_2_evaluate_universality:
      role: Curator
      question: Is this pattern truly universal?
      universal_criteria:
      - criterion: Applies to multiple projects/environments
        weight: High
      - criterion: Framework-agnostic or standard use case
        weight: High
      - criterion: Would developers from OTHER projects benefit?
        weight: High
      - criterion: Not tied to specific business logic
        weight: Medium
      - criterion: Technology-agnostic (or broadly applicable within tech)
        weight: Medium
      decision_points:
        if_mostly_universal:
          action: Proceed to step 3 (quality check)
        if_project_specific:
          action: REJECT with project KB suggestion
          reason: Pattern is useful but not universal
          feedback: 'This pattern is valuable for YOUR project but not suitable

            for Shared KB because it''s too specific to your use case.


            **Suggested Action:**

            Add to your project''s local KB:

            - docs/knowledge-base/errors/ (for errors)

            - docs/knowledge-base/patterns/ (for patterns)


            Tag with: local_only: true


            Example rejection reasons:

            - "Specific to your business domain"

            - "Tied to your specific infrastructure"

            - "Only applicable in narrow context"

            - "Better suited as project documentation"

          checks:
          - Clear problem statement?
          - Root cause explained?
          - Solution steps documented?
          - Code examples included?
        criterion_2:

          checks:
          - Technical accuracy?
          - No factual errors?
          - Follows best practices?
        criterion_3:
          name: Structure
          checks:
          - Valid YAML?
          - All required fields?
          - Proper categorization?
      decisions:
        decision_1_accept:
          condition: All quality criteria MET
          action: ACCEPT and INTEGRATE
          steps: "1. Copy YAML to appropriate Shared KB directory:\n   - universal/patterns/\
