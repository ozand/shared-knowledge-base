    title: "Progressive Disclosure for Documentation"
    severity: "medium"
    scope: "universal"

    problem: |
      Large documentation files (1000+ lines) lead to multiple issues:

      Symptoms:
        • "Fading memory" phenomenon - Claude can't attend to all parts
        • Performance degradation - token usage spikes
        • Difficulty finding information - no clear structure
        • Attention diffuses - too much context at once

      Root Cause:
        Monolithic documentation dumps the entire content at once.
        Like reading a 1000-page book vs a 50-page summary.

      Real Example:
        CLAUDE.md with 1000+ lines:
        ├─ Full API docs
        ├─ Complete database schema
        ├─ All code examples
        └─ All historical decisions

        Result: Claude seems to "forget" parts, misses instructions.
    symptoms:
      - "Claude doesn't follow my CLAUDE.md instructions"
      - "Wrong patterns used consistently"
      - "Performance drops with large files"
      - "Context overflow errors"

    root_cause: |
      No layered information architecture.
      All documentation treated equally regardless of usage frequency.

    solution:
      code: |
        # Three-Layer Documentation Structure

        Layer 1: INDEX.md (Navigation)
        ├─ By Language (English vs Russian)
        ├─ By Category (Core, Automation, Skills, etc.)
        ├─ By Learning Path (Beginner → Expert)
        └─ Quick links to all guides

        Layer 2: README.md (Quick Reference)
        ├─ Table of all guides
        ├─ Brief descriptions
        ├─ Line counts
        └─ Key metadata

        Layer 3: Full Guides (Detailed)
        ├─ Complete documentation
        ├─ Examples & patterns
        ├─ Cross-references
        └─ "Related Guides" sections

        # Example: claude-hooks-guide.md

        ## Quick Overview (Layer 2 - in README)
        Hooks automation reference for Claude Code.
        1,200 lines. 10 hook types documented.

        ## Full Guide (Layer 3 - in guide file)
        [Complete detailed documentation...]

        ## Related Guides (Layer 3 - cross-references)
        - Hooks Examples: @claude-hooks-examples.md
        - Hooks Advanced: @claude-hooks-advanced.md
        - Complete Practices: @CLAUDE-COMPLETE-PRACTICES.md
      explanation: |
        Progressive Disclosure = Show what exists and how to access it,
        let Claude fetch details on demand.

        Benefits:
        1. Claude sees overview first (Layer 1)
        2. Fetches details only when needed (Layer 3)
        3. Better attention to each section
        4. Reduced token usage
        5. Improved performance

        Implementation:
        - INDEX.md = master navigation
        - README.md = quick reference
        - Individual guides = detailed content
        - Cross-references between layers

    prevention:
      - "Always create master INDEX.md for documentation collections"
      - "Keep root README.md lean (< 300 lines)"
      - "Use 'Related Guides' sections for cross-references"
      - "Organize by multiple dimensions (language, topic, level)"
      - "Never dump monolithic documentation without navigation"

    examples:
      - name: "Claude Code Documentation"
        description: "23 guides (~16,100 lines) organized with progressive disclosure"
        implementation: |
          docs/research/claude-code/
          ├── INDEX.md              # Layer 1: Master index
          ├── README.md             # Layer 2: Quick reference
          ├── CLAUDE-*.md           # Layer 3: Detailed guides
          └── claude-*.md           # Layer 3: Detailed guides

          Each guide has "Related Guides" section at end.
          INDEX.md organizes by language, topic, and learning path.
