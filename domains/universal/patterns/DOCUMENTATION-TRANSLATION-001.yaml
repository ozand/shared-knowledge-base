    problem: |
      Mixed language documentation without metadata leads to:

      Symptoms:
        • English speakers can't use Russian documentation
        • Language not clearly marked
        • No way to discover equivalent content in other languages
        • Difficult to maintain consistency across languages

      Root Cause:
        Documentation created in multiple languages without:
        1. Clear language metadata
        2. Organization by language
        3. Cross-references between language versions
        4. Summaries for accessibility

      Real Example:
        8 Russian guides (8,700 lines) added to docs/research/claude-code/
        - No English summaries
        - Not marked as Russian
        - No links to English equivalents
        - English speakers excluded from content

    symptoms:
      - "I can't find English documentation on this topic"
      - "Is this guide available in English?"
      - "What language is this document?"
      - "Duplicate content across languages"

    root_cause: |
      No bilingual documentation strategy.
      No standards for multi-language projects.

        # Bilingual Documentation Strategy

        ## 1. Language Metadata (Required)

        For ALL non-English documentation, add at top:

        ```markdown
        # GUIDE_TITLE

        ## English Summary

        This [Russian/Spanish/etc] guide covers [topic].

        **Key Topics:**
        - Topic 1
        - Topic 2
        - Topic 3

        **Language:** [Language] (~X,000 words)
        **English Equivalent:** See [english-guide.md](link)
        **Quality:** [description]

        **For English Readers:**
        [Brief guidance for English speakers]

        ---
        ```

        ## 2. Organization by Language

        INDEX.md structure:
        ```markdown
        ## By Language

        ### English Documentation
        - List all English guides

        ### Russian Documentation
        - List all Russian guides with summaries
        - Mark which have English versions

        ### Bilingual Guides
        - List guides available in multiple languages
        ```

        ## 3. Three Translation Approaches

        ### Approach 1: English Summary (Recommended for all)
        - Add 2-3 paragraph English summary
        - List key topics
        - Link to related English documentation
        - ~5-10 minutes per guide

        ### Approach 2: Condensed Translation (Critical guides)
        - Translate key sections to English
        - Preserve structure
        - Keep examples and code
        - ~1-2 hours per guide

        ### Approach 3: Full Translation (Essential only)
        - Complete English translation
        - Maintain both language versions
        - Cross-reference each other
        - ~3-5 hours per guide

        ## 4. Language Column in Tables

        Always include language column:
        ```markdown
        | File | Purpose | Lines | Language |
        |------|---------|-------|----------|
        | guide.md | Description | 1000 | English |
        | guia.md | Descripción | 1000 | Spanish |
        ```
      explanation: |
        Benefits:
        1. English speakers can discover and use all content
        2. Clear language metadata prevents confusion
        3. Organized access by language preference
        4. Cross-references connect equivalent content
        5. Maintains accessibility for diverse audiences

        Implementation Order:
        1. Add English summaries to ALL non-English guides (Quick win)
        2. Organize INDEX.md by language
        3. Add language columns to all tables
        4. Translate critical guides to English (Long-term)
        5. Maintain consistency across updates

    prevention:
      - "Never add non-English documentation without English summary"
      - "Always include language metadata in tables"
      - "Organize master index by language"
      - "Provide cross-references to equivalent content"
      - "Mark language clearly in all documentation"

    examples:
      - name: "Claude Code Documentation"
        description: "8 Russian guides enhanced with English summaries"

          Result:
          - English speakers can now discover all content
          - Language clearly marked in all guides
          - INDEX.md organized by language
          - Accessibility improved from 0% to 100%
