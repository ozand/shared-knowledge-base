  problem: 'High-quality contributions are sometimes created using incorrect workflow/process,

    creating a dilemma: reject good content or accept bad process?


    **Core Insight:** Quality ≠ Process. You can have:

    - ✅ High quality + Good process → MERGE

    - ✅ High quality + Bad process → CLOSE + RECREATE

    - ❌ Low quality + Good process → REQUEST CHANGES

    - ❌ Low quality + Bad process → CLOSE


    **Real examples from GitHub Issues:**

    - Issue #8: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ content + ❌ wrong process (agent created PR directly)

    - Issue #9: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ content + ❌ wrong process (agent created PR directly)

    - Issue #10: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ content + ✅ correct process (proper issue)

  decision_matrix:
    framework: 4-Quadrant Decision Matrix
    quadrants:
      quadrant_1:
        quality: High (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
        process: Correct (✅)
        action: MERGE
        reasoning: Perfect contribution - excellent content, proper workflow
        example: 'Issue #10 - Indexing bug fix via proper issue'
      quadrant_2:
        quality: High (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
        process: Incorrect (❌)
        action: CLOSE + RECREATE
        reasoning: 'Preserve excellent content but enforce correct process.

          Curator closes the bad-process contribution (PR or issue)

          and recreates it using proper workflow with attribution.

          '
        example: 'Issue #8 - 5 patterns from PARSER:

          - Agent created PR #4 directly (wrong per AGENT-ROLE-SEPARATION-001)

          - Content: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (comprehensive, production-tested)

          - Action: Closed PR #4, created Issue #8 with proper attribution

          - Outcome: Patterns will be merged after YAML fixes


          Issue #9 - kb_config.py module:

          - Agent created PR #7 directly (wrong workflow)

          - Content: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (critical fix, well-tested)

          - Action: Closed PR #7, created Issue #9 with proper attribution

          - Outcome: Merged immediately (commit 347ecea)

          '
      quadrant_3:
        quality: Medium (⭐⭐⭐)
        process: Correct (✅)
        action: REQUEST CHANGES
        reasoning: Good workflow, content needs improvement. Help contributor enhance
          quality.
        example: Issue with partial information but proper GitHub issue format
      quadrant_4:
        quality: Low (⭐⭐)
        process: Incorrect (❌)
        action: CLOSE
        reasoning: Not worth curator effort. Low-quality content + wrong process =
          reject.

      explanation: Don't let bad process reject good content
    - practice_2: Always preserve excellent content
      explanation: Even if process is wrong, recreate with correct workflow
    - practice_3: Provide clear explanations for actions
      example: 'When closing PR for wrong process:

        - Explain WHY (violated AGENT-ROLE-SEPARATION-001)

        - Show WHAT (correct workflow: AGENT-HANDOFF-001)

        - Be educational, not punitive

    - practice_1: Follow AGENT-HANDOFF-001 workflow

        3. Apply proper labels

        '
    - practice_2: Don't create PRs to shared-knowledge-base
      reason: Violates AGENT-ROLE-SEPARATION-001
    - practice_3: Focus on quality, let Curator handle process
      explanation: Create excellent content, Curator will integrate it

  lessons_learned:
  - lesson: Content quality ≠ Process quality
    insight: Excellent content can come from bad process
    action: Preserve content, correct process
  - lesson: Curator job is to enforce process AND maintain quality
    balance: Don't sacrifice one for the other
    method: Use decision matrix for consistent evaluation
  - lesson: Educational feedback is better than punitive actions
    result: Agents learn correct workflow
    examples: 'Issues #8, #9 - clear explanations provided'
  - lesson: High-quality content worth curator effort to fix process
    threshold: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ content → recreate with correct workflow
    examples: 'Issue #9 - merged same day despite wrong initial process'
  - lesson: Decision matrix provides consistent, fair evaluation
    benefit: Predictable outcomes, clear rationale
    tool: 4-quadrant matrix (quality × process)
