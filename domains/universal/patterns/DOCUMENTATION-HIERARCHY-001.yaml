    title: "Multi-Dimensional Documentation Indexing"
    severity: "medium"
    scope: "universal"

    problem: |
      Single organization method insufficient for complex documentation:

      Symptoms:
        • Users can't find documentation by their preferred method
        • No way to discover content by learning path
        • Difficulty finding related topics
        • New users don't know where to start
        • Experts can't find advanced content quickly

      Root Cause:
      Documentation organized only by one dimension (usually alphabetical).
      No multi-dimensional indexing.

      Real Example:
        23 Claude Code guides (~16,100 lines)
        - Alphabetical listing? Not useful
        - By file size? Not useful
        - Need organization by:
          * Language (English vs Russian)
          * Topic (Core, Automation, Skills, etc.)
          * Learning path (Beginner → Expert)
          * Frequency of use

    symptoms:
      - "Where do I start for learning X?"
      - "What's the advanced guide for Y?"
      - "Is there documentation on Z topic?"
      - "I'm a beginner, what should I read first?"
      - "Show me all guides on topic Q"

    root_cause: |
      Flat documentation structure.
      No hierarchical indexing.
      Single access path only.

    solution:
      code: |
        # Multi-Dimensional Documentation Indexing

        ## Dimension 1: By Language

        ```markdown
        ## By Language

        ### English Documentation (~7,400 lines)
        - [Guide 1]
        - [Guide 2]

        ### Russian Documentation (~8,700 lines)
        - [Guide 3] ✅ English summary added
        - [Guide 4] ✅ English summary added
        ```

        Purpose: Access by language preference
        Users: "I only read English" / "I prefer Russian"

        ## Dimension 2: By Category

        ```markdown
        ## By Topic

        ### CLAUDE.md & Project Memory
        - English: claude-shared-architecture.md
        - Detailed: CLAUDE-CLAUDE-MD-GUIDE.md (1,393 lines)

        ### Hooks (Workflow Automation)
        - English: claude-hooks-guide.md
        - Examples: claude-hooks-examples.md

        ### Skills & Agents
        - Skills: claude-skills-guide.md
        - Agents: claude-agents-guide.md
        ```

        Purpose: Access by topic/domain
        Users: "I need documentation on hooks"

        ## Dimension 3: By Learning Path

        ```markdown
        ## Learning Path

        ### Beginner (New to Claude Code)
        1. CLAUDE-COMPLETE-PRACTICES.md (overview)
        2. claude-shared-architecture.md (fundamentals)
        3. CLAUDE-CLAUDE-MD-GUIDE.md (project memory)

        ### Intermediate (Using Features)
        4. claude-hooks-guide.md (automation)
        5. CLAUDE-PERMISSION-MODES-GUIDE.md (security)
        6. CLAUDE-SLASH-COMMANDS-GUIDE.md (commands)

        ### Advanced (Power User)

        10. CLAUDE-PROJECTS-COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md (teams)
        11. ENTERPRISE-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md (distribution)
        ```

        Purpose: Guided learning progression
        Users: "I'm new, where do I start?"

        ## Dimension 4: By Type

        ```markdown
        ## By Type

        ### Reference Guides (12 files)
        - Comprehensive reference documentation

        ### Practical Examples (6 files)
        - Real-world examples and use cases

        ### Integration Guides (3 files)
        - How to integrate with other tools

        ### Troubleshooting (2 files)
        - Common issues and solutions
        ```

        Purpose: Access by documentation type
        Users: "I need examples / I have an error"
      explanation: |
        Multi-dimensional indexing provides multiple access paths:
        1. **By Language** - Cultural/language preference
        2. **By Topic** - Domain-specific knowledge
        3. **By Learning Path** - Progressive skill building
        4. **By Type** - Usage pattern (reference vs examples)

        Benefits:
        - Users can find content by their preferred method
        - New users have clear starting point
        - Experts can jump to advanced content
        - Related content grouped together
        - Cross-references between dimensions

        Implementation:
        - Create INDEX.md with all 4 dimensions
        - Add cross-references between sections
        - Update when new guides added
        - Maintain consistency across dimensions

    prevention:
      - "Never use flat alphabetical listing for guides"
      - "Always organize by multiple dimensions"
      - "Include learning paths for new users"
      - "Group related content by topic"
      - "Provide type-based organization (reference vs examples)"
      - "Update all dimensions when adding new documentation"

    best_practices:
      - "Start with 3-4 dimensions, expand as needed"
      - "Cross-link between dimensions"
      - "Keep each dimension < 100 lines"
      - "Use clear section headers"
      - "Include line counts and complexity indicators"
      - "Mark language for all content"

    examples:
      - name: "Claude Code Documentation Index"
        description: "23 guides organized by 4 dimensions"
        implementation: |
          INDEX.md structure:

          📚 Quick Navigation (Beginner → Expert flow)
          🌐 By Language (English vs Russian)
          📖 By Topic (Core, Automation, Skills, etc.)
          📊 By Type (Reference, Examples, Integration)

          Result:
          - 4 different access paths
          - Clear starting point for new users
          - Quick discovery by topic
          - Language preference respected
          - Usage pattern accommodated
