    scope: "universal"

    problem: |
      Documentation sprawl causes confusion:
      - Too many files in root directory
      - Massive duplication across files
      - Unclear navigation
      - Mixed content (overview + details + analysis)

      Example: 38 markdown files in root, users don't know where to start

    target_structure:
      for_new_projects: |
        # Root directory (maximum 5 files)
        project-root/
        ├── README.md           # Brief overview (< 250 lines)
        ├── QUICKSTART.md       # Quick start (< 250 lines)
        ├── GUIDE.md            # Implementation guide (optional)
        └── docs/
            ├── research/       # Analysis & reports
            ├── archive/        # Deprecated/obsolete
            └── guides/         # Detailed guides
                ├── installation/
                ├── integration/
                └── workflows/

      explanation: |
        **Progressive Disclosure:**
        1. README.md - Overview → Links to details
        2. QUICKSTART.md - Quick start → Links to advanced
        3. docs/guides/ - Detailed guides by category

        **Key Principles:**
        - Maximum 5 files in root
        - Brief overview upfront (not everything)
        - Link to detailed content (don't duplicate)
        - Clear categorization (research/archive/guides)

        **README.md Structure (< 250 lines):**
        - Overview (2-3 sentences)
        - Quick start (1 command + link)
        - Key features (bulleted list)
        - Documentation links (not duplication)
        - Contributing (brief)

    reorganization_workflow:
      title: "Multi-Phase Reorganization for Existing Projects"
      when_to_use: "When existing documentation has become unwieldy or difficult to navigate"

      phase_1_archive_legacy:
        duration: "30 minutes"
        steps: |
          1. Create archive directory structure:
             ```bash
             mkdir -p docs/archive/legacy
             ```

          2. Move problematic files:
             - Files with very long names (>100 chars)
             - Outdated documentation
             - Files with encoding issues
             - Duplicate content

          3. Create archive index:
             ```markdown
             # Archive Documentation Index
             Maps old files to new equivalents
             ```

      phase_2_create_hierarchy:
        duration: "2 hours"
        steps: |
          1. Organize by type and purpose:
             ```
             docs/
             ├── api/              # API documentation (5-10 files)
             ├── reference/        # Reference docs (10-15 files)
             ├── guides/           # Guides and tutorials (5-10 files)
             └── archive/          # Legacy docs
             ```

          2. Create index files for each section:
             - `api/00-INDEX.md` - Overview and navigation
             - `reference/00-INDEX.md` - Overview and navigation
             - `guides/README.md` or similar

      phase_3_entry_points:
        duration: "30 minutes"
        steps: |
          1. Main documentation README:
             ```markdown
             # Documentation

             ## Quick Start Paths
             - For Beginners: Quick Start → Basics → Configuration
             - For Developers: Pattern Library → Reference
             - For Integrators: API Overview → Methods
             ```

          2. Navigation by role:
             - Beginner-friendly path
             - Developer-focused path
             - Integrator-focused path

      phase_4_cleanup:
        duration: "20 minutes"
        steps: |
          1. Remove backup files:
             ```bash
             find examples/ -name "*.backup" -delete
             find examples/ -name "*_old.*" -delete
             find examples/ -name "*.bak" -delete
             ```

          2. Update .gitignore:
             ```gitignore
             # Backup files
             *.backup
             *.bak
             *_old.*
             ```

      phase_5_readmes:
        duration: "1 hour"
        steps: |
          1. examples/README.md with:
             - Parsers by difficulty
             - Categories (Search, E-commerce, Social, etc.)
             - Usage instructions
             - Learning paths

          2. scripts/README.md with:
             - Available scripts
             - Usage examples
             - Configuration

          3. lib/README.md with:
             - Available libraries
             - Usage documentation

      phase_6_update_references:
        duration: "30 minutes"
        steps: |
          1. Update PROJECT.md with new structure
          2. Update AGENTS.md with documentation links
          3. Update SKILLS.md with new resources
          4. Add cross-references (40+ new links)

    examples:
      - scenario: "New user wants to get started"
        workflow: |
          User reads: README.md (overview)
          User clicks: QUICKSTART.md link
          User follows: Installation steps
          User clicks: Advanced topics links
          Result: Progressive discovery, not overwhelmed

      - scenario: "Experienced user needs details"
        workflow: |
          User skips: README.md overview
          User goes directly to: docs/guides/integration/
          User finds: Detailed technical guide
          Result: Clear path to detailed content

      - scenario: "Before reorganization"
        workflow: |
          User sees: 38 files in root
          User confused: Which file to read?
          User frustrated: Can't find quick start
          Result: Abandoned, poor UX

      - scenario: "After reorganization"
        workflow: |
          User sees: 4 files in root
          User starts: README.md (clear overview)
          User continues: QUICKSTART.md (link from README)
          User satisfied: Found what they needed quickly
          Result: Successful onboarding

    best_practices:
      for_new_projects:
        - "Maximum 5 .md files in root"
        - "README.md < 250 lines (overview only)"
        - "Link to details, don't duplicate"
        - "Move temporary files to docs/archive/"
        - "Create docs/ structure from project start"
        - "Review file count monthly"

      for_reorganization:
        - "Plan before executing"
        - "Use TodoWrite tool for tracking phases"
        - "Keep legacy docs (archive, don't delete)"
        - "Create README files (one per major directory)"
        - "Update all references (cross-links, TOC, quick start paths)"
        - "Archive, don't delete (preserve history, allow rollback)"

    prevention:
      - "Plan documentation structure before project starts"
      - "Create docs/ hierarchy early (research/archive/guides)"
      - "Move temporary files to archive immediately"
      - "Review file count weekly in early stages"
      - "Set up file count monitoring (alert if >5 in root)"

    anti_patterns:
      - pattern: "Everything in root"
        problem: "38 files, confusing"
        solution: "Organize into docs/ subdirectories"

      - pattern: "Massive README"
        problem: "600+ lines, overwhelming"
        solution: "Brief overview (< 250 lines), link to details"

      - pattern: "Duplication everywhere"
        problem: "Same content in 5 files"
        solution: "Write once, link to it"

      - pattern: "No clear structure"
        problem: "Mixed analysis, guides, obsolete"
        solution: "Clear categories: research/archive/guides"

      - pattern: "Deleting legacy docs"
        problem: "Lost history, can't rollback"
        solution: "Archive to docs/archive/legacy/ with INDEX.md"

    lessons_learned: |
      1. **Archive, don't delete**
         - Legacy docs may have value
         - Preserve history
         - Allow rollback if needed

      2. **Create multiple entry points**
         - Different users need different paths
         - Beginner vs Developer vs Integrator
         - Quick reference vs deep dive

      3. **README files are crucial**
         - Every major directory needs one
         - Include navigation, examples, links
         - Make it self-explanatory

      4. **Cross-reference everything**
         - 40+ new links added
         - Connect related concepts
         - Aid discoverability

      5. **Track progress with TodoWrite**
         - 6 phases tracked
         - Clear status (pending/in_progress/completed)
         - Easy to resume

    time_estimates:
      new_project: "1-2 hours (setup initial structure)"
      reorganization: "4-5 hours (6 phases total)"
      ongoing_maintenance: "15 min/week (review file count)"
