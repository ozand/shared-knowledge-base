  title: Development Documentation System (Task Tracking)
  severity: high
  scope: universal
  problem: 'During long Claude Code sessions, Claude can lose context about:

    - Current task objectives and requirements

    - Background context and constraints

    - Sub-tasks and progress tracking

    - Decisions made and their rationale


    This leads to:

    - Repetitive explanations

    - Lost context during long sessions

    - Difficulty resuming work after interruptions

    - No persistent task history

    '
  symptoms:
  - Claude asks the same questions repeatedly
  - Loses track of task requirements mid-session
  - Cannot resume work after context limit reached
  - No clear record of what was done and why
  - Difficulty maintaining state across multiple sessions
  root_cause: 'No persistent documentation system for tracking development tasks

    and context within .claude/ directory. Claude has no dedicated place

    to store and retrieve task-specific information.

    '
  solution:
    code: '# Development Documentation System Pattern

      # Create task-specific directories in .claude/dev/


      # Directory structure:

      # .claude/dev/

      # ├── task-YYYY-MM-DD-name/

      # │   ├── plan.md      # Task requirements and approach

      # │   ├── context.md   # Background context and constraints

      # │   └── tasks.md     # Sub-tasks checklist

      # └── task-YYYY-MM-DD-other/

      #     ├── plan.md

      #     ├── context.md

      #     └── tasks.md


      # Example: .claude/dev/task-2026-01-07-user-auth/plan.md

      # # User Authentication System

      #

      # **Date:** 2026-01-07

      # **Status:** In Progress

      #

      # ## Objectives

      # - Implement JWT-based authentication

      # - Add user registration and login endpoints

      # - Create authentication middleware

      #

      # ## Requirements

      # - Use FastAPI framework

      # - JWT tokens with 24h expiration

      # - Password hashing with bcrypt

      # - Refresh token mechanism

      #

      # ## Technical Approach

      # 1. Create auth module structure

      # 2. Implement JWT token generation/validation

      # 3. Build registration/login endpoints

      # 4. Add authentication middleware

      # 5. Write tests for all components

      #

      # ## Constraints

      # - Must follow existing project structure

      # - Use existing database models

      # - Maintain API consistency


      # Example: .claude/dev/task-2026-01-07-user-auth/context.md

      # # Context: User Authentication

      #

      # ## Project Background

      # - Project: E-commerce API

      # - Stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis

      # - Current auth: Basic (needs upgrade)

      #

      # ## Previous Attempts

      # - Tried OAuth2 (too complex for requirements)

      # - Considered session-based (doesn''t scale)

      #

      # ## Technical Constraints

      # - Database: PostgreSQL 14

      # - Cache: Redis for token blacklist

      # - Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes

      #

      # ## Integration Points

      # - Must integrate with existing user model

      # - Should work with current API structure

      # - Must not break existing endpoints

      #

      # ## Dependencies

      # - python-jose[cryptography] for JWT

      # - passlib[bcrypt] for password hashing

      # - Existing user service module


      # Example: .claude/dev/task-2026-01-07-user-auth/tasks.md

      # # Tasks: User Authentication

      #

      # ## Phase 1: Setup

      # - [x] Create auth module directory

      # - [x] Install dependencies (python-jose, passlib)

      # - [x] Set up JWT configuration

      #

      # ## Phase 2: Core Implementation

      # - [x] Implement password hashing utilities

      # - [x] Create JWT token generation

      # - [x] Create JWT token validation

      # - [ ] Build registration endpoint

      # - [ ] Build login endpoint

      # - [ ] Implement refresh token logic

      #

      # ## Phase 3: Integration

      # - [ ] Create authentication middleware

      # - [ ] Add protected route decorators

      # - [ ] Integrate with existing user model

      #

      # ## Phase 4: Testing

      # - [ ] Write unit tests for utilities

      # - [ ] Write integration tests for endpoints

      # - [ ] Test middleware with protected routes

      # - [ ] Test token refresh flow

      #

      # ## Phase 5: Documentation

      # - [ ] Update API documentation

      # - [ ] Add usage examples

      # - [ ] Document deployment steps


      # Integration with Claude Code workflow:

      #

      # 1. Start new task:

      #    User: "Start task: Implement user authentication"

      #    Claude: Creates .claude/dev/task-YYYY-MM-DD-user-auth/

      #            - Generates plan.md from requirements

      #            - Creates context.md template

      #            - Initializes tasks.md checklist

      #

      # 2. During development:

      #    Claude: References @dev/task-YYYY-MM-DD-user-auth/plan.md

      #            Updates @dev/task-YYYY-MM-DD-user-auth/tasks.md

      #            Adds decisions to context.md

      #

      # 3. Resume work:

      #    User: "Continue with user auth task"

      #    Claude: Reads @dev/task-YYYY-MM-DD-user-auth/plan.md

      #            Checks tasks.md for progress

      #            Continues from last checkpoint

      #

      # 4. Complete task:

      #    Claude: Marks all tasks complete

      #            Creates summary in plan.md

      #            Archives task directory

    explanation: "The Development Documentation System provides persistent task tracking\n\
      and context management for long Claude Code sessions.\n\n**Key components:**\n\
      \n1. **plan.md** - Task blueprint\n   - Objectives and requirements\n   - Technical\
      \ approach\n   - Constraints and considerations\n   - Updated with decisions\
      \ made\n\n2. **context.md** - Background information\n   - Project background\n\
      \   - Technical constraints\n   - Integration points\n   - Previous attempts\n\
      \n3. **tasks.md** - Progress tracking\n   - Checklist of sub-tasks\n   - Organized\
      \ by phases\n   - Real-time progress updates\n   - Completion status\n\n**Benefits:**\n\
      1. **Persistent context** - Survives context limit resets\n2. **Quick resume**\
      \ - Pick up where you left off\n3. **Decision record** - Why certain approaches\
      \ were chosen\n4. **Progress tracking** - Clear visibility into completion status\n\
      5. **Reduced repetition** - No need to reexplain requirements\n\n**Implementation\
      \ pattern:**\n- Create task directory: `.claude/dev/task-YYYY-MM-DD-name/`\n\
      - Initialize with templates for plan.md, context.md, tasks.md\n- Update files\
      \ during development\n- Reference using `@dev/task-name/file.md` syntax\n- Archive\
      \ when complete\n\n**Integration with skills:**\n- Skills can reference task\
      \ docs: `@dev/current-task/plan.md`\n- Commands can create task templates\n\
      - Hooks can auto-update tasks.md on completion\n"

    result: Seamless multi-session development
  benefits:
  - Persistent context across sessions
  - Quick resume after interruptions
  - Decision history and rationale
  - Clear progress tracking
  - Reduced repetition and explanations
  - Better task organization
  - Automatic documentation of work
  prevention:
  - Create task directory before starting complex work
  - Update tasks.md as you complete sub-tasks
  - Record decisions in context.md or plan.md
  - Use @ references to keep Claude aware of task docs
  - Archive completed tasks to dev/complete/
  - Keep task descriptions focused and specific
  - Date task directories (task-YYYY-MM-DD-name)
  - One task per directory for clarity
