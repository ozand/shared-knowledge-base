    pattern: |
      Complex tasks should be decomposed into sub-tasks handled by specialized agents (Research, Coding, Review).
      A "Coordinator" or "Orchestrator" agent maintains the global state and delegates tasks, preventing context pollution.
    implementation: |
      # 1. Orchestrator: Receives high-level goal, breaks it down.
      # 2. Specialist: Receives specific sub-task, clear context, and tools.
      # 3. Handoff: Specialist returns result + summary to Orchestrator.
      
      # Example Structure in .opencode/agents/
      # orchestrator.md
      # researcher.md
      # coder.md
      
      # Workflow
      # User -> Orchestrator -> (delegates) -> Researcher -> (returns) -> Orchestrator -> (delegates) -> Coder...
