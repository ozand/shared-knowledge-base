  title: Passwords in Environment Variables
  severity: critical
  scope: docker
  problem: Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables are visible in docker
    inspect, can leak in logs, and are accessible to any process with access to the
    container.
  symptoms:
  - Passwords visible in docker inspect
  - Secrets in docker-compose.yml files
  - API keys in environment variables
  wrong_code: "services:\n  postgres:\n    environment:\n      - \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword\"\
    \n      - \"POSTGRES_USER=admin\"\n"
  correct_code: "# Option 1: Use Docker Secrets (Swarm mode)\nservices:\n  postgres:\n\

  solution_steps: '1. Use Docker Secrets in Swarm mode

    2. Use external secret managers (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

    3. At minimum: use .env files (not committed to git)

    4. Restrict file permissions: chmod 600 .env

    5. Never commit secrets to git

    6. Use .env.example templates

  title: Missing Network Isolation
  severity: medium
  scope: docker
  problem: All containers on default network can communicate with each other. No segmentation
    between frontend and backend services. Compromised container can access internal
    services.
  symptoms:
  - All containers on bridge network
  - Frontend can reach database directly
  - No network segmentation
  wrong_code: "services:\n  frontend:\n    image: nginx:latest\n  backend:\n    image:\
    \ myapi:latest\n  database:\n    image: postgres:latest\n  # All on same network\
    \ - no isolation\n"
  correct_code: "networks:\n  frontend:\n    driver: bridge\n  backend:\n    driver:\
    \ bridge\n    internal: true  # No internet access\n\nservices:\n  frontend:\n\
    \    image: nginx:latest\n    networks:\n      - frontend\n\n  backend:\n    image:\
    \ myapi:latest\n    networks:\n      - frontend\n      - backend\n\n  database:\n\
    \    image: postgres:latest\n    networks:\n      - backend  # Only accessible\
    \ from backend\n"
  solution_steps: '1. Create separate networks for frontend/backend

    2. Make backend network internal (no internet)

    3. Connect database only to backend network

    4. Connect backend to both networks

    5. Connect frontend only to frontend network

    6. Test isolation: docker exec frontend ping database (should fail)

  title: Running as Root User
  severity: high
  scope: docker
  problem: Container running as root has full access to host system if compromised.
    Process can escape container with root privileges.
  symptoms:
  - 'User: root in docker inspect'
  - Processes run as root inside container
  - Security vulnerability if container breached
  wrong_code: "services:\n  myservice:\n    image: myimage:latest\n    # Runs as root\
    \ by default\n"
  correct_code: "services:\n  myservice:\n    image: myimage:latest\n    user: \"\
    1000:1000\"  # Use non-root user\n    volumes:\n      - ./data:/app/data\n   \
    \ # Fix volume permissions\n"
  solution_steps: '1. Create dedicated user in Dockerfile

    2. Run with user: UID:GID in docker-compose.yml

    3. Ensure volume permissions match: chown -R 1000:1000 ./data

    4. Verify: docker exec CONTAINER whoami

    5. Use read-only root filesystem where possible: read_only: true
